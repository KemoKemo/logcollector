# Windows software log collector (Wisloc)

This tool works to collect all of your software logs and windows event logs.

## Why Wisloc

When trouble occurs, we must gather logs of our software.

Most of the files and information to be gathered are different for each software, so it is surprisingly difficult to collect the necessary files exactly with human hands each time.

But please be relieved. Wisloc makes that very easy.
